Hi guys,
I've attached the updated Proc51 spreadsheet based on our last meeting. The major change was to handle the case where the DS and US portions could have different ecoregion designations.

* the ecoregions are set by using the drop downs in C5 and D5 on the main Proc. 51 Macro Data sheet.

* You'll see on the Summary Defs sheet that there are now two "green" regions at the top that contain the metric related parameters for whatever the DS and US ecoregions are selected.

* Remember, someone still needs to go through the Proc51 guidelines and update the main lookup table on the Summary Defs sheet where ever I've left it yellow. By doing this, you'll also get a better understanding of how the app works. I've left reminder comments on this sheet regarding this.

* Once the yellow regions are updated, the workbook is ready to be tested using historical data. Happy to help with this.

If you decide you want to have me start to look at your stream temperature data, just let me know.

Hope all is well in the watershed.
Mark
